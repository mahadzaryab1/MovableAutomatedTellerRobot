# Purpose

The Movable Automated Teller Robot(ATM) was made as part of an engineering design project.  
The project tackled a soution to an existing problem using a Lego EV3 kit and Tetrix.
Specifically, the design made was a mobile ATM that could facilitate daily banking needs 
at a local branch by providing a more accessible option.

# About the Movable Automated Teller Robot

Using Lego's variant of C/C++ called RobotC, this robot was programmed so that it could
deposit and withdraw money through colour organization. Furthermore,
the robot had security functions that included a code that is input
using a rotating number dial, three password attempts and a card-specific
bank account. Please refer to the 'RobotImplementation' file for more about how the robot
was programmed.

# More about our project 
For more about the design process and actual implementation of the robot, please refer to the 
file titled 'Final Design Report' as well as the photos folder to see the finished product.
